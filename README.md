# KABOOM! in 146 lines of Parallel ML

A port (MPL) of a [port (Futhark)](https://github.com/athas/tinykaboom) of the
[KABOOM (C++)](https://github.com/ssloy/tinykaboom) tiny graphics program.

Here's my current result at 24 fps with MPL. (Also see `boom-60fps.gif`,
but high framerate GIFs don't seem to play very well in the browser for
some reason...)

This is using my homegrown GIF library for MPL, which needs some work (the
color palette choice is not ideal).
